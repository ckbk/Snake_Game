Snake Game - CAO Kha Bao Khanh 2017

This is a snake game project that I wrote for an university assignement around 11/2017. 
This game is based of the works of other people as mentionned in the LICENSE file, which can be accessed in game.
To compile, go to the main directory and compile using gcc ./src/*.c -o ./snake_game.exe -lncurses

The game features a single player mode where the player control a snake and eat food with randomized points, therefore
eating food with more points will result in a shorter snake with higher score. The highscore will be kept in a seperate 
file (highscore.dat) on the hard disk.
The game also has a 2-player mode where 2 players can compete to see who can survive longer.
